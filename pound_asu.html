<h2>What do you guys talk about in here?</h2>
<p>There's really no guidelines to conversation. Since nearly all channel
  members are students at Arizona State University, conversations about
  ASU classes and events are common. However, conversations about a
  wide variety of non-ASU topics are common as well. <tt>#asu</tt>
  is simply one of many social gathering places for ASU students on
  the internet.</p>

<h2>Who runs <tt>#asu</tt>?</h2>
<p>ASU is a student-run channel and has no affiliation with ASU in any
  official capacity.</p>

<h2>How do I get +v/voice/that little gold star.</h2>
<p>By registering an account with network services, you will automatically
  be given voice in the channel. For information on how to register,
  see <tt>/msg NickServ HELP REGISTER</tt>. Note that you must log into
  your account (see <tt>/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY</tt>) each time you
  connect to the network, though many IRC clients can be configured
  to do this automatically. (For the IRC savvy, StaticBox supports
  authentication through client certificates and SASL as well.)</p>
<p>Registering an account offers more advantages than just voice,
  though. An account is associated with one or more nicknames, all of
  which are "protected" by the network services software. If somebody
  attempts to use your nickname while you are not connected, it will
  ask them politely to log in to the account. If they don't log in, when
  you eventually connect and log in, you can forcefully remove them from
  the network and use the nickname yoursel. See <tt>/msg NickServ HELP
  GHOST</tt> for more information on this feature. (NickServ may also
  be configured to be more strict about people using your nickname. For
  information on this, see <tt>/msg NickServ HELP SET ENFORCE</tt>.)</p>
<p>For those curious about the purpose of giving +v to registered users,
  it is merely a precautionary measure. (Voice only makes a difference
  if the channel is "moderated" or +m)</p>

<h2>This IRC server does not support channel modes like founder, admin,
  or halfop. What gives? For that matter, why does nobody but ChanServ
  have channel operator privileges?</h2>
<p>Regarding founder, admin, and halfop modes, this is a heavily debated
  topic in the IRC community and will not be addressed here. However,
  even if the IRCd <i>did</i> offer these modes, they would not be used,
  as is explained in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Since <tt>#asu</tt> is not affiliated with any sort of organization
  or project, it doesn't make much sense to mark people as "channel
  staff." The focus of <tt>#asu</tt> is on its users, not its
  facilitators. The channel founders and staff can perform all necessary
  channel management functions through ChanServ, so channel operator
  status has little to offer.</p>

<h2>Why did you choose StaticBox and not this other network OtherNet?</h2>
<p>This is mainly because of the preference of the channel
  founders. However, StaticBox has a lot of great things going for it.
  It's a small network, compared to networks like EsperNet or Freenode,
  so it's very easy to interact with and get help from the network
  staff. Additionally, the network staff are very closely involved
  with the development of the software run by StaticBox (which is
  also the software run by man other networks, including EsperNet and
  Freenode.)</p>
