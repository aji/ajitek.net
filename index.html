      <h1>&#x270c; Alex Iadicicco @ AJITEK.net</h1>
      <p>Welcome to <b>Alex Iadicicco</b>'s Internet home. My presence is
        scattered across the Internet. This website serves to connect my
        various identities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/aji">aji on GitHub</a></b> &mdash;
          Coding is what I spend most of my free time doing. You can find
          what I am currently working on on my GitHub page. </li>
        <li><b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/ajitek">AJITEK on
          SoundCloud</a></b> &mdash; I also make a considerable amount of
          music. You can check that out on my SoundCloud page.</li>
        <li>My PGP public key ID is <strong>2CF82BB5</strong>, and can be
          obtained from <strong>keys.gnupg.net</strong>. Or, if you'd rather,
          it can be downloaded <a href="0x2CF82BB5.asc">here</a>.</li>
        <li>My SSH public key can be downloaded <a href="id_rsa.pub">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Mails can be sent to <strong><code>alex</code></strong> at this
          domain. I have a bunch of other emails as well, but I'd prefer if
          those weren't used, since I'm trying to phase them out.</li>
        <li>IRC is probably the most reliable way to get in touch
          with me. If I am at my computer and have a working internet
          connection, then I usually have my IRC client open and am paying
          attention to it. I can be found on <strong>AthemeNET</strong>,
          <strong>EsperNet</strong>, and <strong>Freenode</strong> using
          the nickname <strong>aji</strong>. I am also registered to the
          services on these networks, so if I am not around send me
          a memo.</li>
