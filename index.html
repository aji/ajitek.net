      <h1>&#x270c; Alex Iadicicco</h1>
      <p>Welcome to <b>Alex Iadicicco</b>'s Internet home. My presence is scattered
        across the Internet. This website serves to connect my various identities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/aji">aji on GitHub</a></b> &mdash; Coding
          is what I spend most of my free time doing. You can find what I am currently
          working on on my GitHub page. </li>
        <li>IRC is probably the most reliable way to get in touch with me. If
          I am at my computer and have a working internet connection, then I
          usually have my IRC client open and am paying attention to it. I can
          be found on <strong>StaticBox</strong>, <strong>EsperNet</strong>, and
          <strong>Freenode</strong> using the nickname <strong>aji</strong>. I am also
          registered to the services on these networks, so if I am not around send me
          a memo.</li>
